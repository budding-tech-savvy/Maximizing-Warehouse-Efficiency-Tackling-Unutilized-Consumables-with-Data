Problem: In our warehouses, a significant amount of consumables was sitting unused. These unutilized materials were not only taking up valuable space but also represented a financial burden for the company. We needed to find a way to understand where and why this was happening.

Challenges: The data related to unutilized consumables was scattered across multiple hubs and categories. Without a clear understanding of which hubs or materials were causing the most inefficiency, it was difficult to make informed decisions. We also needed a way to present this data in a format that non-technical stakeholders could easily understand.

Solution: As a data analyst, I worked with datasets that included details about consumable items, hub locations, stock quantities, and their financial value. Using tools like pivot tables and charts, I summarized the total unutilized stock in several dimensions:

Hub-wise: Identifying which warehouses had the most unused stock.
Category-wise: Highlighting consumable types that were underutilized.
Material-wise: Pinpointing specific items causing inefficiencies.
The visualizations, including pivot charts and column charts, made the data easy to interpret and allowed decision-makers to quickly grasp the situation.

Benefits: This analysis gave us a clear understanding of where improvements were needed. By identifying problem areas, we were able to:

Reallocate unused stock to areas of need.
Optimize purchasing decisions, avoiding overstocking.
Free up warehouse space and reduce costs.
This simple yet powerful approach helped the company improve overall operational efficiency and save money by making better data-driven decisions.
